# codepath-ios-prework
Completed prework for code paths ios development course! 

App brainstorming:
- Pokemon Sleep: I love the easy interface for sleep tracking, and the ability to gamify healthy habits. 
- Instagram: I love how all the interfaces are aesthetically pleasing and user-friendly. 
- Capcut: I love how cap cut simplifies video editing into its most essential form, making it easy for new creators to start making content. I also love how it can sync with your Tiktok or Instagram for easier access to songs. 


An app that I would love to build is a mix of pokemon sleep and a habit tracker. I love to create a game type application for tracking good habits, and the more days you log your habits, you'll be able to collect pets/accessories/etc. and share with your friends.
